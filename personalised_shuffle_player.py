1 - BASIC PRACTICE MODE:
â€¢ In this mode, the songs will be shuffled and will be played in a random order from anywhere in the song for a minute(60 seconds).
â€¢ The user needs to guess the song name and enter the name of the song. 
â€¢ If the user's first guess is right, the program will tell you him/her that they are right and move to the next song.
â€¢ If the user's first guess is wrong, it will you give him/her another chance to guess the song name. 
â€¢ If the user's second is wrong, it will print the song name and continue playing for the entire duration.
â€¢ The player will repeat the above steps for all the songs in the playlist and finally, ask the user if they want to practice another time.
â€¢ The user can practice the listening as many times as he/she wants by pressing "yes".
â€¢ If the user presses "no", it will exit the program.

2 - ADVANCE PRACTICE MODE:
â€¢ The user will be asked if they want to play the 1-minute excerpt from the first half or the second half of the song.
â€¢ If the user selects the first half, then the songs will be shuffled and will be played in a random order from anywhere in the first half of the song for a minute(60 seconds)
â€¢ If the user selects the second half, then the songs will be shuffled and will be played in a random order from anywhere in the second half of the song for a minute(60 seconds)
â€¢ The user needs to guess the song name and enter the name of the song. 
â€¢ If the user's first guess is right, the program will tell you him/her that they are right and move to the next song.
â€¢ If the user's first guess is wrong, it will you give him/her another chance to guess the song name. 
â€¢ If the user's second is wrong, it will print the song name and continue playing for the entire duration.
â€¢ The player will repeat the above steps for all the songs in the playlist and finally, ask the user if they want to practice another time.
â€¢ The user can practice the listening as many times as he/she wants by pressing "yes".
â€¢ If the user presses "no", it will exit the program.

3 - MOCK TEST MODE:
â€¢ This mode is designed purely for test practice.
â€¢ In this mode, the player will play songs as if it is being played in the test. The user will NOT have the option to guess and type the song's name.
â€¢ The user will listen to each song and write down the name and artist of the song like they would in a test. Then, they will press enter and the next song will start playing.
â€¢ The player will repeat the process for all the songs in the playlist and at the end, it will print the song names according to the order played for the user to verify.
